# LinkedInHardMode
This repository is forcused on analyzing my 186 #LinkedInHardMode post performances.

# How to Use This Repository

The result of my most current work is available [here](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/LinkedInHardMode/blob/main/LinkedInHarderModeReport.pdf) and you can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/LinkedInHardMode/blob/main/Analysis_HarderMode.R). 

The post performance data files (CSVs) include performances current as of the number of days into daily posting as indicated in the file name. E.g. [LinkedInPostPerformancesDay117.csv](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/LinkedInHardMode/blob/main/LinkedInPostPerformancesDay117.csv) has historical performances with values current as of Day 117. 

The R files [Analysis.R](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/LinkedInHardMode/blob/main/Analysis.R), [Analysis_HarderMode.R](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/LinkedInHardMode/blob/main/Analysis_HarderMode.R), and [Final_Analysis.R](https://github.com/davidmvermillion/LinkedInHardMode/blob/main/Analysis_HarderMode.R) contain all the code used to create the final products. The other R files were experimentation files for fine-tuning how I created the types of charts indicated by the file names. 

The two file folders are image outputs of the charts I considered most relevant to my final reports.

## Future Details
Day 186 was my final daily post, so all future content will be related to those 186 days.

I may consider recreating the analyses and charts using other software, such as Excel and Tableau.

## Tips for Future Analysis in R
Data in ggplot with dates need to be formatted in YYYY-mm-dd or mm/dd/YYYY format for import.
